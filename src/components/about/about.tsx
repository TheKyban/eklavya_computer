                    computer education. It is a matter of great proud and
                    pleasure that our country is a fast developing country in
                    economy, education, science & technology etc. India is a
                    large population which needs to enhance human capital in
                    developed country. In study conducted by World Bank it has
                    been found that the role of human capital in development is
                    far more important than physical capital. For India, it has
                    been estimated that access to at least 25% of the relevant
                    age group, between 17 to 23 in high education is necessary
                    to ensure development on a par with the needs of the day. In
                    this context EKLAVAYA GLOBAL COMPUTER, initiated a program
                    to provide IT education in various grades and courses to the
                    people of India sub-continent. AGC is committed to embracing
                    an inclusive quality assurance culture, and has developed a
                    number of policies and procedures to ensure that our courses
                    and services are the highest quality in the IT education and

                    prepare our students for further study, or careers in the
                    I.T. and Business global economies. Now when different
                    reforms are taking place in the field of education in our
                    society students are contributing at the international
                    level, but the Centers for Higher Education are charging so
                    heavily that the common person are getting no benefits of
                    it. Therefore, we have taken a small step to enable those
                    weaker sections of the society who are unable to seek
                    asmission in those traing centers. Today we are having a
                    large range of Computer Centers in various states from where
                    many of students are earning name and fame after doing
                    different computer courses successfuly. Therefore walk into
                    our center for nomination and shake hands with us in this
                    efforts in the direction of the social welfare.
