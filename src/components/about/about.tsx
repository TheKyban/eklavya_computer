                    economy, education, science & technology etc. India is a
                    large population which needs to enhance human capital in
                    developed country. In study conducted by World Bank it has
                    been found that the role of human capital in development is
                    far more important than physical capital. For India, it has
                    been estimated that access to at least 25% of the relevant
                    age group, between 17 to 23 in high education is necessary
                    to ensure development on a par with the needs of the day. In
                    this context EKLAVAYA UNIVERSAL PRIVATED LIMITED, initiated

                    further study, or careers in the I.T. and Business global
                    economies. Now when different reforms are taking place in
                    the field of education in our society students are
                    contributing at the international level, but the Centers for
                    Higher Education are charging so heavily that the common
                    person are getting no benefits of it. Therefore, we have
                    taken a small step to enable those weaker sections of the
                    society who are unable to seek asmission in those traing
                    centers. Today we are having a large range of Computer
                    Centers in various states from where many of students are
                    earning name and fame after doing different computer courses
                    successfuly. Therefore walk into our center for nomination
                    and shake hands with us in this efforts in the direction of
                    the social welfare.
